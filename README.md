   Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process.

The Virtual code, Python, Git account were already created before the before the beginning of the class. The only software I had to install was MySQL. The installation went smoothly with the help of [the documentation](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-mysql-on-windows). The only issue I encountered was that the MySQL Workbench did not come with MySQL software, I had to download it from [HERE](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) and install it different, after that, the whole setups were complete.

For further studies on MySQL, check W3Schools tutorials on [SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp) and [MySQL](https://www.w3schools.com/mysql/default.asp)
